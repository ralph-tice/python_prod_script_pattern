[operatingops.org](operatingops.org) instead of submitting an issue.

1. Write everything you know. Think of all the questions a maintainer might ask and write in the answers.

1. Remember that this is free software! We have day jobs ðŸ‘·. We might not respond right away.

To increase the chance that your pull request gets accepted:

* Write tests.
* Follow [Simple Style](https://github.com/operatingops/simple_style/blob/v0.1.0/SIMPLE_STYLE.md).
* Write [good commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
* Organize your commits. "Fix typo" and "work in progress" commits are hard to follow. If you like to commit often,
  check out git's [rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/about-git-rebase/). You can use it to clean up at the end.
